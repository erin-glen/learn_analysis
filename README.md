## **Introduction**

This repository contains tools for analyzing land use changes and community impacts using geographic information system (GIS) data. The primary focus is on forest analysis and community analysis, providing insights into land cover transitions, carbon stock variations, greenhouse gas emissions/removals, and socio-economic factors affecting communities.

The tools are designed to be user-friendly and well-documented, enabling researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to perform complex spatial analyses with ease.

## **Features**

- **Forests Analysis (`forests_analysis.py`):**
  - Analyzes land use changes between two time periods.
  - Calculates carbon stock changes, greenhouse gas emissions, and removals.
  - Processes disturbances such as fire, insect damage, and harvest activities.
  - Generates detailed reports and summaries.

- **Communities Analysis (`communities_analysis.py`):**
  - Assesses the impact of land use changes on communities.
  - Evaluates socio-economic indicators.
  - Integrates demographic data with spatial analyses.
  - Provides visualizations and statistical summaries.

- **Helper Functions (`funcs.py`):**
  - Contains reusable functions for data conversion, raster processing, and statistical calculations.

- **Lookup Dictionaries (`lookups.py`):**
  - Provides mappings for NLCD categories, disturbance types, and carbon stock loss factors.
